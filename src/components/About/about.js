            <p className='pb-4'>My love of all things software development began in university where (after initially applying to a Life Sciences degree) I took an Intro to Coding course, fell in love, and changed my major immediately. I graduated from <a href='https://www.yorku.ca/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer' className='highlight transition duration-200 border-b border-transparent hover:border-pink'>York University</a> in April 2020 with a Hons. Bachelors in Computer Science.</p>
            <p className='pb-4'>It's been a long journey since that first course and I've loved every step of it! I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer at <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/' target="_blank" rel='noreferrer' className='highlight transition duration-200 border-b border-transparent hover:border-pink'>AWS Bedrock</a> where I am focusing on building systems to automate capacity management.</p>
            <p className='pb-4'>In my free time, I love to read, sew, crochet, paint murals on my apartment walls, design printed circuit boards, expand my Pok√©mon figurine collection, and learn about cool new technologies!</p>
            <p className='pb-4'>Please explore this site and feel free to contact me should you have any questions or comments!</p>
